UPDATE quest_template SET Details = 'Sorrowguard has stood since its construction before the First War. While the orcs destroyed it during that war, the walls still stand. This, of course, is thanks to Watch Paladin Janathos. Without his efforts in bringing the workforce here and conducting repairs this place would be nothing more than a smoldering ruin.$B$BIt is with this knowledge of the past that we must protect what we have done here. The orcs of Stonard are our main enemy. We do not seek to cause an all-out open war, but to be scouted by our foe would potentially cause our destruction.$B$BAlready Stonard Scouts have been probing eastward, and we must stop them. Venture out there and kill any you find. Do so in the same manner as the brave footmen who died defending these walls years ago.' WHERE entry = 40079;

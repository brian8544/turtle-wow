UPDATE quest_template SET Details = 'After reading this report, it is clear that the sentinel presence has been less than helpful in Forest Song. Not only have they refused to follow the tactical plans suggested by Brolthan, but the display of bravado has led to the death of many sisters and daughters. To lose the blood of kin is a pain I know all too well.$B$BI know not if this was a simple mistake on Commander Starwind''s part, or if it was deliberate misconduct, but regardless, her actions demand consequences. One less supporter of this new way of living in a leadership position, spread by that fool Tyrande and her ilk, will only solidify the Kaldorei as a traditional and united force. I will make the changes to the records, while you bring my notice to the commander. Inform Ironglade to present you with a suitable reward, too.$B$BI do not care if you think me heavy-handed or cruel, $c. Hopefully, this situation will teach you something about viewing the greater picture.' WHERE entry = 40805;

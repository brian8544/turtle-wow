# Turtle WoW DiscordOverlay.dll 

Custom DLL which contains actual information about the Turtle WoW game client required by the Discord application. 

Windows Defender has been falsely blocking our DiscordOverlay.dll. We decided to go open source to prove that there is no harmful content inside the library in question. The file which we distribute with our patcher is identical.

For all future releases starting with 1.15.1 we are going to include PDB files. 

You have to unflag it manually with the following steps if the file is currently quarantined on your PC:

1. Open Window Security in your right bottom taskbar.
2. Go to Virus & Scan protection.
3. Open allowed threats.
4. Remove our library from the list. 

On the next launch of the game, your discord status "Playing Turtle WoW" will appear again! Thank you, we apologize for this inconvenience.
